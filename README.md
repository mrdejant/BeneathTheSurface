Beneath The Surface Of The Scratch Ticket
=================

This is my ludum dare 29 entry. Theme was beneath the surface.

Game was made in 48 hours using Eclipse and LibGdx. 

I downloaded sounds and music from https://www.freesound.org/. Detailed list can be found in assets folder.

INSTRUCTIONS

Your goal is to win as much money as you can with only 5 scratch tickets. 

On the first screen you can select your ticket price - more expensive the ticket, the more you win. You can scratch off a little bit of the ticket before you buy it. If you don't like it, just pass it and try another one. But beware, if you scratch it to much, you will be forced to buy it.

Game is over if you loose all your money or when you buy your fifth ticket.
